# Latent-Semantic-Signatures
Matrix outlook on the Tree of Life
To systematically explore hypothesis of species evolution through cohesive mode of molecular drive we constructed over 50,000 species models based on Latent Semantic Analysis. We substituted sequence alignment with natural language processing and distributional semantics in order to test for existence of cohesive information between sequences that cannot be aligned, but share taxonomy as common denominator. This revealed distributional similarity between gene translations belonging to species proteomes. Despite being members of different gene families, all translated sequences exhibited shared information content related to their organism taxonomic lineage in form of short interspersed motifs. We present evidence of large-scale molecular drive contribution not limited to multigene families and other paralogous sequences, highlighting its importance as a full-fledged evolutionary force.
